- Keep BOT_TOKEN and other secrets in Render environment variables (do NOT store in repo).
- Consider moving heavy tasks to a separate paid worker outside Render free tier if load increases.
- Replace yt-dlp search/probe with provider APIs (YouTube Data API, Spotify API) for better reliability and TOS compliance.
- Monitor costs for S3 and network egress.
- Implement user quota and rate-limits if opening bot to public.
- Consider metrics (Prometheus) and error tracking (Sentry) for production.
